# Video_Generation_Evaluation_Metric
Today, Research on video generative models is actively progressing.  
Nevertheless, Evaluation Metrics are hidden here and there and are not unified.  
  
So this repo aims to Minimum Implementation for Video Generation Evaluation  
### I implemented a widely used metric for Video Generation. 
- Inception Score  
- Frechet Inception Distance
- Frechet Video Distance
- Clip Similarity

# ToDo
- [x] FVD
- [x] FID for Video Eval (averaged over video frames)
- [x] IS for Video Eval
- [x] CLIP similarity for Video Eval (averaged over all generated video frames)
- [ ] Clean Code
- [ ] update readme
